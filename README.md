# rock-paper-scissors

## About the Project:
### This is my first project in Python, which I developed a very simple game called rock, paper and scissors, where the user plays against the computer. In this project I could learn how to use if, elif, else and for loop. As well as lists and the input command.  

## How to play the game:
### To play the game, the user must choose between rock, paper and scissors then the computer makes its play randomly. 
### In each try the user is able to see the result of the play. If he/she won, lost or if it was a tie. 
### You can run this game in PyCharm or any Code Editor of your preference.
